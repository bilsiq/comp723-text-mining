# Abstract

# Introduction

As the lkdrjejtj increases for example dvgfgdfg.
Which generates all types of data. In this study we will be focusing on text mining. 
Text mining is defined as “the process of analyzing natural language text to glean information 
& patterns that are useful”. 
Emailing is a very common way of communication used by both organisations and ind
ery unstructured, which makes text mining challenging.

In this study we will be training different types of models using different libraries in python particularly Natural Language Tool-Kit (NLTK) and Scikit-Learn. 
These models are going to be trained on how to correctly identify legitimate emails from spam emails.



# Methods

Data collection:

The data was provided to us by Auckland University of technology. 
The data is already separated into ham or spam folder resceptifully.
 There are 5975 number of total email. 
 Number of ham emails are 3672 and the number of spam emails are 1500.
 the ratio of ham emails to spam emails is 1:3 (spam:ham). 
 The first ham email dates back to 10-12-1999, last ham email dates back to 11-01-2002. 
 The first spam email dates back to 18-12-2003, last spam email dates back to 06-09-2005.

Data preparation: 

Below are the pre-processing step we took to get the data ready for our models to be trained on

1. Adding labels to the emails respectfully (ham or spam)
2. Stemming the data
3. Removing stop words
4. Removing punctuations
5. Tokenization of the emails
